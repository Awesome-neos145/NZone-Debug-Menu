# NZone-Debug-Menu
Pretty self-explanatory. A debug menu for Nintendo Zone built off of SatellaZone!

# Download
To download, Go to the releases tab.

# Original SatellaZone link
I wouldn't be leaving a project without credit. Here is the SatellaZone link: https://github.com/MegaPika/SatellaZone

# How to apply?
Pretty simple. Drag the luma folder to the root of the SD card. (If it says to replace files, click yes.)

Just like SatellaZone, you need the Nintendo Zone viewer to be installed to your system. I will not send the link. (You need a O3DS, O3DSXL, or O2DS to install to a N3DS system.) (Google may be your best friend.)
